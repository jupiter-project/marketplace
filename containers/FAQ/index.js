    asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items 
    such as photos, videos, audios, in-game items, and any other type of digital file. As an artist, 
    by tokenizing your work, you ensure that it is unique and that the ownership is provably 
    yours. Leda is an NFT marketplace that uses the Jupiter blockchain, where NFTs are called 
    Singleton Asset Tokens.`,

    If you don’t have one or want to create a separate one for Leda, hit the Sign up button and follow 
    the steps. Be sure to write down your passphrase and save it in a secure place. If you lose your

    title: '11. Can I add a time limit for my auction?',
    description: (
      <>
        The NFT system on the Jupiter blockchain doesn’t allow to enter a bidding period in the
        process itself, but if you really want to set a defined period for your sale there is a sort of workaround.
        <br />
        The info in your My Account section can be updated and is shown on the NFT detail page of all of your NFTs.
        If you would like to add a specific sell period for one of your NFTs you could update your account info
        with for example “sale of {'<NFT title>'} ends on {'<date/time UTC>'}”.
        <br />
        When that time has been reached you can cancel your sell order, and sell it to the person with the highest
        bid (by putting it for sale for the  price of the highest bid). Next, you can remove the auction info again
        from your account info.
        <br />
        Note: the description of the NFT itself can’t be changed, that is final once it has been created.
        So please don’t add any dates in there, they will be there forever and it would look very strange
        if the buyer of your NFT would like to resell it later on.

        a little bit longer.
